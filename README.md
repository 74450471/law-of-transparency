In this repository I am sharing the small project within the domain of bio physics. It argues that cognitive activity creates the electrical signals that might be converted to light eventually fostering light mediated interactions between systems 1 and systems 2. The formulas and code were co created by me and Chat GPT 4o

The following set of formulas tries to depict the chain of events that captures the process by which cognitive activity in one system (System 1) could influence neural activity in another system (System 2) through the mediation of light emission and photon transmission. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the comprehensive framework:

Cognitive Activity in System 1 Influences Membrane Potential:

Cognitive activity (
𝐴
𝑡
A 
t
​
 ) in System 1 causes changes in the membrane potential (
𝑉
𝑚
V 
m
​
 ) of neurons. This relationship can be described by:

Membrane Potential Affects Current Through the LED:

The change in membrane potential 
𝑉
𝑚

m
​
  influences the current 
𝐼
I through an LED connected to System 1. This is modeled as:
𝐼
=
𝐴

(

I=A⋅V 
m
​
 (t)

where 
𝐴
A is a proportionality constant.
Current Through LED Leads to Emission of Optical Power:

The electrical power (
𝑃
electrical
P 
electrical
​
 ) supplied to the LED, which depends on the current 
𝐼
I and the voltage 
𝑉
V, leads to the emission of optical power (

 ):

where

Emission of Photons Carrying Energy and Electromagnetic Wave Characteristics:

The optical power

​
  results in the emission of photons. The energy 
𝐸
E of each photon is related to its frequency 
𝜈
ν by:
𝐸

The number of photons emitted per second (

Photon Emission Affects Neural Activity in System 2:

The emitted photons travel through space and can be detected by System 2. The energy and information carried by these photons can influence the neural activity in System 2. For example, if System 2 has photosensitive cells or sensors that respond to the incident photons, the neural activity in System 2 can be modulated based on the received light signal.

Bringing these elements together, the overall relationship can be summarized as:
