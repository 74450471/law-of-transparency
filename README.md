The computer model tries to model the following process: 

1)cognition in system 1 creates electrical impulses
2)those electrical impulses are transmitted by light akin to that happening in optogenetics 
3)once received from light they create electrical impulses in another system 2
4)this forms a process that might be called interaction so that the transmission of information is allowed.

At the same time, there might be a need to consider formulas in which we could see the number of constants present in the computer model.
