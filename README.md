# t-c1
In this repository I am sharing the small project within the domain of bio physics. It argues that cognitive activity creates the electrical signals that might be converted to light eventually fostering light mediated interactions between systems 1 and systems 2. The code creates the computer model of this process. At the same time, there should be a significant consideration of the formulas that stipulate the constants applied in the model. I would reserve my right to call it the process t-c1
