The computer model tries to model the following process: 

1)cognition in system 1 creates electrical impulses
2)those electrical impulses are transmitted by light akin to that happening in optogenetics 
3)once received from light they create electrical impulses in another system 2
4)this forms a process that might be called interaction so that the transmission of information is allowed.

At the same time, there might be a need to consider formulas in which we could see the number of constants present in the computer model.

The computer model number 1 represents the following equations which try to cover the process of cognitive activity in system 1 resulting in electrical activity which could be converted into light: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IbWJWsrgVUQEa9IOckBpa5Zf-I_uEW9ChcmPfyLjfME/edit 
The computer model number 2 represents the respond in the neural activity within system 2 due to the number of emitted photons: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MSb2X6Q5L3N9MHgdC--K24w92Ea22niEkBCNdQX8pcQ/edit
The computer model number 4 incorporates the application of string theory to light particles
