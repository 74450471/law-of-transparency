In this repository I am sharing the small project within the domain of bio physics. It argues that cognitive activity creates the electrical signals that might be converted to light eventually fostering light mediated interactions between systems 1 and systems 2. The formulas and code were co created by me and Chat GPT 4o

The following set of formulas tries to depict the chain of events that captures the process by which cognitive activity in one system (System 1) could influence neural activity in another system (System 2) through the mediation of light emission and photon transmission. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the comprehensive framework:
